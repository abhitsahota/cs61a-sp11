This is my attempt to complete course cs61a taught at Berkeley during spring 2011.
The course is based on fantastic "Structure and interpretation of computer programs".


I'm trying to
 - do readings on sicp: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ 
 - watch video lectures: https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=-date
 - do homework: http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/nodate-hw.pdf
 - do projects: http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/vol1.html
 - take midterms: http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/vol2.html
 - take final: http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/vol2.html

Homepage: http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp11/  
Homework solutions:
